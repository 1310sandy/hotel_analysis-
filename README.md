# HOTEL CANCELLATION PROJECT

## Overview
This project analyzes hotel booking data to identify cancellation patterns and trends. The dataset includes details on hotel reservations, guest demographics, room assignments, and reservation statuses. The analysis is conducted entirely in **Microsoft Excel** using pivot tables and dashboards.

## Features & Methodology
### 1. **Data Collection & Cleaning**
- The **hotel_bookings** sheet contains raw booking data, including:
  - Hotel type (City Hotel, Resort Hotel)
  - Cancellation status
  - Arrival date details (year, month)
  - Number of adults, children, and babies
  - Guest country
  - Reserved vs. assigned room types
  - Reservation status and booking confirmation dates
- Data was cleaned to remove inconsistencies and missing values.

### 2. **Pivot Table Analysis**
- The **pivot** sheet provides summarized insights, such as:
  - The total number of bookings and cancellations for each guest type (Couple, Family, Single, etc.).
  - Cancellation trends across different hotel types.
  - Percentage of cancellations versus total bookings.

### 3. **Dashboard Visualization**
- The **dashboard** sheet presents visual insights using:
  - Charts and graphs to depict booking trends and cancellation rates.
  - Summary metrics highlighting key observations.
  - Conditional formatting to emphasize important data points.

## Key Insights
- Cancellation rates vary based on guest type, hotel type, and seasonality.
- Resort hotels may experience different booking patterns compared to city hotels.
- Certain room types have higher cancellation rates, affecting inventory planning.

## Tools Used
- **Microsoft Excel**
  - Pivot Tables
  - Charts & Graphs
  - Conditional Formatting
  - Data Cleaning Techniques

## How to Use
1. Open the **Excel file** and navigate between the three sheets:
   - `hotel_bookings` (Raw data)
   - `pivot` (Summarized data)
   - `dashboard` (Visual representation)
2. Use the pivot table filters to explore different guest types and booking trends.
3. Analyze the dashboard charts to gain insights into cancellation behaviors.

## Conclusion
This Excel-based project provides a **comprehensive analysis of hotel cancellations**, helping hotels optimize booking strategies and reduce revenue losses due to cancellations. Future enhancements may include integrating Power BI or additional predictive analysis in Excel.
